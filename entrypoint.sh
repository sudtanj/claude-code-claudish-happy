# Entry point for the claude-code-claudish-happy image.
#
# Usage:
#   docker run ... claude              # plain Claude Code (default)
#   docker run ... codex               # plain Codex CLI (BYOK via CODEX_BASE_URL)
#   docker run ... happy claude        # Claude Code wrapped by Happy (mobile/web control)
#   docker run ... happy codex         # Codex wrapped by Happy
#   docker run ... background happy claude
#   docker run ... background happy codex
#                                       # Runs the given command inside a
#                                       # detached tmux session (a real pty,
#                                       # so the wrapped CLI's UI works
#                                       # whether or not the container itself
#                                       # was started with -it), then keeps
#                                       # the container running indefinitely
#                                       # so you can connect from the Happy
#                                       # app later without an attached
#                                       # terminal. Run with `docker compose
#                                       # up -d` (not `run --rm`, which is
#                                       # for one-off foreground use). Peek
#                                       # at it locally any time with:
#                                       #   docker exec -it <container> tmux attach -t happy
#                                       # (Ctrl-b d to detach without
#                                       # stopping it.) Pair Happy once,
#                                       # interactively, BEFORE going this
#                                       # route - see HAPPY_CREDENTIALS_B64
#                                       # below; an unpaired background run
#                                       # exits almost immediately after
#                                       # printing the pairing QR/link into
#                                       # a pane nobody's watching.
#   docker run ... bash                # drop into a shell with all CLIs on PATH
#
# Before exec'ing the requested CLI, this checks that the environment
# variables that CLI needs were actually supplied (e.g. via `environment:`
# in docker-compose.yml or `docker run -e ...`), and fails fast with a clear
# message instead of letting the CLI hang on a login prompt or die deep in
# its own startup code.
#
# For `codex` / `happy codex`, it also registers a custom
# OpenAI-Responses-API-compatible endpoint given via CODEX_BASE_URL (+
# optional CODEX_API_KEY / CODEX_MODEL) in ~/.codex/config.toml - see
# configure-codex-provider.sh and .env.example.
#
# For `happy` / `happy codex`, it pre-seeds Happy's pairing credentials
# from HAPPY_CREDENTIALS_B64 if set (see configure-happy-credentials.sh),
# then - if there's still no valid Happy credential - runs `happy auth
# login` (Happy's own pairing-only subcommand) BEFORE touching Claude Code
# or Codex at all, so a fresh/unpaired container never launches a real
# session it can't actually hand off to Happy.
